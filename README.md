# MixxedMessages
The aim of this project is to build a simple java script that will generate random content(random mixed message) each time the program runs.

## General Info
+ This project is a part of Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Path
+ The content of this exercise is based on Game of Thrones written by G. R. R. Martin
+ The program generates 4 types of messages:
  + Random blessing from different god for today
  + Random Quote by character from Game of Thrones
  + Author of said quote( in this part the program sticks to the author so the name of author is not random but authentic as I though this would be a better implementation)
  + Suggestion of random House with the words of said house
  
 ## Technologies
